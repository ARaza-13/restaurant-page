This project is basic restaurant page site themed around the notorious underwater restaurant in Bikini Bottom, The Krusty Krab!

This project was made by bundling together Javascript modules using webpack, as the entire contents of the webpage is generated through Javascript DOM manipulation. Other intermediate Javascript concepts were utilized such as importing, exporting, and event listeners.
